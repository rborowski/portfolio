    About me
  </header>
  <h1 class="text-h6 text-sm-h5 mb-5">
    I am a full stack developer with a strong backend focus and a versatile technical background,
    based in Gdynia, Poland 📌
  </h1>
  <p class="text-body-2 text-sm-body-1">
    I specialize in building scalable backend systems, custom platform extensions, and robust integrations using C#,
    PHP, TypeScript, and Python. My work spans from creating enterprise-grade solutions based on REST APIs and SDKs, to
    refactoring legacy systems into clean, modular architectures. I’m experienced in working with complex data flows,
    validation logic, and containerized environments. <br />
    I’m confident in client-facing environments, enjoy digging into business domains, and thrive in Agile teams where
    analytical thinking meets clean code and pragmatic engineering.<br />
    <br />
    Let’s build something great together 🚀
