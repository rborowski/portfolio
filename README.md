# My personal website

[![🚀 Production deployment](https://github.com/rborowski/portfolio-first/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rborowski/portfolio-first/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

Hi, I proudly present you the source code for frontend of my personal website.

This website was built with lots of ❤️, and:
- **Vue 3** (yes, Composition API),
- 🍍 **Pinia** state management,
- **Vuetify 3** with i.e. [unplugin-vue-router](https://github.com/posva/unplugin-vue-router), [unplugin-vue-components](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-vue-components), Layouts and Material Design 3.

This frontend was built with multi-SPA pattern. This structure consists of a few separate SPAs in one Vue 3 setup. The aim is to build separate frontend apps with one codebase.

## 💿 Install

Set up your project using yarn package manager. Use the command to install the dependencies:

[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started)

yarn install
```

After completing the installation, your environment is ready for Vuetify development.
